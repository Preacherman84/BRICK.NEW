<strong>What The BRICK Ministries Can Do:</strong>

1. We provide a three to five day supply of food for an individual or family once each month.

2. We provide 4 BART Bus passes per individual each month, as long as the monthly supply lasts.

3. We can give program participants vouchers to area thrift stores: MMC Thrift in Ashland or ABC Thrift in Washburn. The amount participants can receive varies depending on the thrift store. Ten vouchers are given out each month for each shop. Participants may receive one voucher every three months.

4. The Benevolence Manager works with people who are facing financial emergencies. Benevolence funds are used for participants with utility bills, rent, travel out of town for medical treatment, temporary shelter (1-3 nights), and other emergent needs.
