At The BRICK, we help the hungry in our communities. We provide an assortment of food items, both non-perishable and fresh, to families in need. They may visit The BRICK’s Food Shelf once each month, receiving three to five days’ worth of groceries. This is emergency, supplemental food, which The BRICK obtains from the Federal Emergency Food Assistance Program, Second Harvest Food Bank, Wal-Mart’s Feed America Program, and donations from area churches, community organizations, and individuals.

In 2015 we gave out an average of 34,000 pounds of food to 700 households each month. We served a total of 19,380 individuals during the year, and distributed 415,391 pounds of food.</span>
