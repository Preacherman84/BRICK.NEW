The BRICK’s mission is to help people in need, providing compassionate, respectful help to families and individuals facing emergencies and crisis. The Benevolence Manager works one on one with area residents who need short term aid. Together, they determine a plan, establish a workable budget, and set goals that will assist the family to move forward and avoid financial shortfalls in the future.

As the Benevolence Manager and families explore solutions, they look first at existing community resources and services. When needed, the Benevolence office provides services that are not available elsewhere. With donations and matching funds from Northern State Bank’s Make a Difference Foundation, the Salvation Army, area churches, and private individuals, The BRICK provides emergency shelter, fuel and utility assistance, rental assistance, and other emergency aid.

The Benevolence office is located at The BRICK’s Ashland location, 420 Ellis Avenue. Due to high demand, we recommend making an appointment. Please call or email to schedule a meeting with the Benevolence Manager: (715) 682-7425,  benevolence.thebrick@centurytel.net
