  <em>Dear Friends, 
    <br /><br /> 
    The BRICK Ministries is a crucial resource to those in our community who are facing food insecurity and financial crisis. Will you join us in offering a hand up by making a gift to The BRICK today? It&rsquo;s #GivingTuesday! Your tax-deductible gift will really make an impact. Your donation will help put food on the tables of hundreds of households throughout Ashland and Bayfield Counties each month, will help keep families in their homes with their electricity and water running, and will serve the homeless with shelter. Thanks so much for your commitment to serving our community through The BRICK&rsquo;s essential service programming. Your partnership and generosity will go a long way, and we are truly grateful. Wishing you and yours a holiday season filled with joy!</em></span></div>
